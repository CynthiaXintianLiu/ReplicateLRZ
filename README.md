# ReplicateLRZ
We replicated paper called  via Stata. First, we grabbed the data from Compustata, and then we replicated tables and individual-fixed and time-fixed regressionsvia Stata.
The results are slight different from the raw data, and it is basically because Compustata keeps updated its data every year.
Hope we can get a full score in this project lol!

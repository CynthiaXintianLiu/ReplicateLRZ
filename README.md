# ReplicateLRZ
This is a course project from class Fin 971(PHD Corporate Finance).\\
We replicated paper(LRZ) via Stata. \\
First, we grabbed the data from Compustata, and did the data manipuliation to combine Compustata data(fundmental yearly data) with CRSP (securities monthly data). Second, we replicated tables and conducted individual-fixed and time-fixed regressions via Stata.\\
The results are slight different from the raw data, and it is basically because Compustata keeps updated its data every year.\\
Hope I can get a full score in this project lol!
